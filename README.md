1. Pizza categories, sizes, and pricing  
2. Daily & time-based order trends  
3. Total sales performance  
4. High-demand & low-demand menu items

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. Identified 4 pizza categories — Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken.  
2. 49,574 pizzas sold in 2015 — strong demand.  
3. Classic category recorded the highest sales (14,888 units).  
4. All categories exceeded 5,000+ sales, showing balanced menu performance.  
5. Average pizza price: $16.44 (mid-level pricing strategy). 
6. Peak ordering occurred after 8 PM.  
7. Identified 5 pizzas with zero orders — mainly Big Meat & Cheese items.  
8. Price differences ranged from $2.75 to $23.95, with The Greek showing the highest jump.
  
## 💡 Recommendations
1. Remove or redesign pizzas with zero orders.  
2. Promote high-selling categories like Classic & Supreme via combos.  
3. Run evening promotions to target the peak order window.  
4. Reassess pricing for premium pizzas (e.g., Greek XXL).  
5. Increase focus on medium-sized pizzas, which dominate customer preference.
